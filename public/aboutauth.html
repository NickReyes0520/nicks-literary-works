      <h2>Ronie “Nick” G. Reyes</h2>
      <p>
        Ronie “Nick” G. Reyes, known by his pen name <strong>Nick Reyes</strong>, is an author, bibliophile, and researcher based in San Nicolas, a historic suburb of Binondo, Manila in the Philippines.  
      </p>
      <p>
        A lifelong lover of books and ideas, with a soul bound to stories, inquiry, and literature, Nick has written and composed more than <strong>fifteen (15) published works</strong> spanning diverse genres, from fiction and poetry to philosophical essays and theological reflections. His works are deeply rooted in extensive research, yet guided by creativity and imagination, making him a multidisciplinary voice in today’s literary landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nick writes to inspire people, document his studies, and share meaningful stories, facts, and viewpoints. His wide-ranging interests, from folklore, mythology, psychology, and human behavior, to philosophy, faith, and even the mysteries of the unexplained, add a unique depth and curiosity to his craft. When not writing, he enjoys filmmaking, poem and song composing, journaling, sketching, or immersing himself in music together with his beloved bandmates.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Nick, writing is both a pursuit of truth and a journey of wonder—one that invites readers to think, reflect, and see the world in new and meaningful ways.
